This repository is a comprehensive collection of **TensorFlow Probability** implementations for probabilistic deep learning. The *primary* goal is **educational**: to bridge the gap between traditional deterministic models and real-world uncertainty quantification. 


✨**Unlock the power of uncertainty quantification in machine learning.** 

This repository provides hands-on implementations of probabilistic deep learning using TensorFlow Probability (TFP), enabling you to build models that not only make predictions but also quantify how confident they are about those predictions.

> **Documentation**: [TFP API Docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp)



## 🎯 Overview
![tfp-map](_img/tfp_map.png)

### What Makes This Repository Special?

Traditional machine learning models provide point estimates without quantifying uncertainty. In critical applications like medical diagnosis, autonomous vehicles, or financial modeling, **knowing how confident your model is** can be the difference between success and catastrophic failure.

- Enables models to express confidence levels using probabilistic layers and Bayesian neural networks.

- Supports sampling, log-likelihood evaluation, and manipulation of complex distributions (univariate & multivariate).

- Powers VAEs and normalizing flows for density estimation, representation learning, and synthetic data generation.

This repository demonstrates how **TensorFlow Probability** transforms your standard neural networks into probabilistic powerhouses that:

- **Quantify uncertainty** in predictions
- **Model complex distributions** beyond simple Gaussian assumptions  
- **Perform Bayesian inference** at scale
- **Generate realistic synthetic data** through advanced generative models


### Why Probabilistic Deep Learning Matters

</p>



Real-world data is messy, incomplete, and uncertain. Probabilistic deep learning addresses these challenges by:

- **Handling Data Scarcity**: Bayesian approaches work well with limited data.
- **Robust Decision Making**: Uncertainty estimates guide better decisions.
- **Interpretable AI**: Understanding model confidence builds trust
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying outliers and unusual patterns.
- **Risk Assessment**: Quantifying potential failure modes.


#### ⚙️**Technical Strengths**
- Bayesian neural networks: Adds priors to weights and calibrates predictive uncertainty for out-of-distribution robustness.

- Normalizing flows: Uses invertible transforms for expressive density estimation and efficient sampling.

- Variational inference: Optimizes ELBO with reparameterization for controllable generation and learning.

#### 🚀**Trade-offs & Performance**
- Higher memory and training time than deterministic models.
- Gains in interpretability, calibrated risk, and anomaly detection often outweigh the cost

## 🎲 Core Probability Distributions

Understanding these distributions is crucial for effective probabilistic modeling:

---

### 📊 Discrete Distributions

#### **Binomial Distribution**  

Models the number of successes in \(n\) independent trials with probability \(p\).

$$
P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
$$

**Use Cases**: A/B testing, quality control, medical trials  

---

#### **Poisson Distribution**  

Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval.

$$
P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
$$

**Use Cases**: Customer arrivals, system failures, web traffic  

---

### 📈 Continuous Distributions

#### **Gaussian (Normal) Distribution**  

The cornerstone of probabilistic modeling with symmetric, bell-shaped curves.

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
$$

**Use Cases**: Neural network weights, measurement errors, natural phenomena  

---

#### **Exponential Distribution**  

Models waiting times and survival analysis.

$$
f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, \quad x \geq 0
$$

**Use Cases**: System reliability, queueing theory, survival analysis  

---

### 🌐 Multivariate Distributions

#### **Multivariate Gaussian**  

Essential for modeling correlated variables with full covariance structure.

$$
f(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^k|\boldsymbol{\Sigma}|}}
\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{x}-\boldsymbol{\mu})^T\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1}(\mathbf{x}-\boldsymbol{\mu})\right)
$$

**Use Cases**: Dimensionality reduction, portfolio optimization, computer vision
